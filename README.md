# College-Talent
Author: Naman Kanwar, Harnoor Singh, Jonathan Ding, An Tran
# Inspiration
I am international student paying out of state. I have seen students like me in need of money who can sell their talent for it.

# What it does
This is a platform that helps student (selling talent), who canâ€™t afford the to pay for college, find potential donor.

# How we built it
We have built the proof of concept using InVision.

# Challenges we ran into
Technical difficulties setting up nodejs. First time working on web-development. Insufficient storage on our computers.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a unified vision that allows for expansion and rapid implementation. Researching potential technologies to maximize time vs. output.

# What we learned
The beauty of Unix environments. Setting up a development environment is often most of the battle. Choosing a correct framework for web development can take time.

# What's next for CollegeTalent
Implementation using NodeJs hosted on an EC2 instance hooked up with AWS DynamoDB (cheaper than Firebase Firestore), along with OAuth authentication and FCM for instant notification of matches. Hopefully also sentiment analysis (IBM Personality Analysis API) on applicant essays to match with a donor's values.
